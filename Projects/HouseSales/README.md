# House Sales Price Prediction
# view Link : https://www.kaggle.com/code/ahmedealtwy/housesales/notebook
This project aims to analyze historical house sales data and build a predictive model to estimate future house prices. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we can provide valuable insights to real estate agents, buyers, and sellers.

# Key Steps and Components:

## 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
 - Gather a comprehensive dataset containing information about house features (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, location, amenities).
 - Clean the data by handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.

## 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
 - Visualize the data to understand its distribution, correlations, and trends.
 - Identify patterns, anomalies, and potential predictors.

## 3. Feature Engineering:
 - Create new features from existing ones (e.g., total area, age of the house).
 - Encode categorical variables (e.g., neighborhood, house type) into numerical representations.

## 4. Model Selection and Training:
 - Choose appropriate regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, random forest, gradient boosting).
 - Split the data into training and validation sets.
 - Train the models using the training data.

## 5. Model Evaluation:
 - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).
 - Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize the model.

## 6. Prediction and Interpretation:
 - Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data.
 - Interpret feature importance to understand which factors influence house prices the most.
