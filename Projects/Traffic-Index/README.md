# Summary
in this project, i analyzed The dataset included information on Traffic index in the middle east.


# Solution
## Data Loading and Exploration: 
I imported necessary Python libraries (such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib) in a Jupyter Notebook. Then, I loaded the retail dataset, checked for missing values, and explored basic statistics

## Data Cleaning:
I handled missing data, removed duplicates, and standardized column names.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Using visualizations (bar plots, line plots, etc.), I examined Traffic Jams, Delay, Index, etc.

## Approach
Time Series Analysis: To understand sales trends over time, I applied time series decomposition and identified patterns.

Country/City Performance Metrics: I calculated metrics like and identified Highest Country With Traffic Problems.

Visualization: I created interactive charts (using Matplotlib or Seaborn) to communicate findings effectively.
