# Overview
The project focuses on leveraging data science techniques to enhance sales performance for an online retail dataset. This project, involves a comprehensive workflow that includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to uncover actionable insights for improving sales strategies.
# Solution
### Data Loading and Exploration:
imported necessary Python libraries (such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib) in a Jupyter Notebook. Then, I loaded the retail dataset, checked for missing values, and explored basic statistics

### Data Cleaning:
handled missing data, removed duplicates, and standardized column names.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Using visualizations (bar plots, line plots, etc.), I examined sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

# Approach
### Time Series Analysis: 
To understand sales trends over time, I applied time series decomposition and identified seasonal patterns.

### Customer Segmentation: 
group customers based on purchasing behavior.

### Product Performance Metrics: 
I calculated metrics like revenue per product category and identified top-selling items.

### Visualization: 
I created interactive charts (using Matplotlib or Seaborn) to communicate findings effectively.
