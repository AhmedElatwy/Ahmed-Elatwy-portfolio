Technology Trends Analysis (IBM Capstone Project)Technology Trends Analysis (IBM Capstone Project)
Feb 2024 - Feb 2024

# Summary
in this project, I analyzed sales data from an Overflow 2019 survey. The dataset included information on Popular technology now, Future and Demographic.


# Solution
Data Loading and Exploration: I imported necessary Python libraries (such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib) in a Jupyter Notebook. Then, I loaded the retail dataset, checked for missing values, and explored basic statistics

Data Cleaning: I handled missing data, removed duplicates, and standardized column names.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using visualizations (bar plots, line plots, etc.), I examined Technology trends, programmer behavior and Demographic Difference.


# Approach
Time Series Analysis: To understand sales trends over time, I applied time series decomposition and identified patterns.

Product Performance Metrics: I calculated metrics like and identified top-trending products and technologies.

# Purpose of Analysis:
- Identify the top programming languages, database, platform and web frame skills in demand
- Spot The Expected Trend In the future
- Understand Gap Reasons in the Industry for Human Resources.
  
# Data Collection:
- Stack Overflow 2019 Survey
- GitHub Job Postings
- Programmers Annual Salary
  
• Applied Data Cleaning, Analysis and Visualization using necessary tools and statistics in order to obtain Decision making
